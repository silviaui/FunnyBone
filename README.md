## 📝 Introduction 

Are you tired of long hours staring at code that just won't cooperate? Do you find yourself laughing at your own bugs? Well, you’re in the right place! The **FunnyBone Project** is here to help you navigate the coding chaos with a smile. Our mission? To turn every “error” into an “uh-oh” and every “bug” into a “feature!”

## 😎 Features

- **Hilarious Error Messages**: Why settle for "404 Not Found" when you can get "Oops! Even Google couldn’t find this one!"?
- **Random Joke Generator**: Feeling down? Get a chuckle with just one command! (Warning: May cause snorts!)
- **Witty Documentation**: Our docs are filled with puns and light-hearted explanations—because who said documentation has to be boring?

Getting started is as easy as pie (or at least easier than finding your keys)! Just clone the repo and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/What?😉/funnybone.git
